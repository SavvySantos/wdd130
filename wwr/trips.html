        <h2>Fishing Trips!</h2>
        <p>Adventure Missoula can boast that there are 7 major rivers within two hours driving time from our headquarters -centrally located- with the purpose to have the time of our lives guiding others and enjoying it ourselves.
            We track the river flows, follow the hatches, and understand how the wild and unpredictable weather affects our rivers and streams. Our season is Mid March through Mid November, weather permitting. We pride ourselves on
            being true Western Montana natives. We feel blessed to be fly fishing Missoula Montana! Guided trips are an excellent way to learn how to fly fish or spin fish and know what to fish with and when. All trips are private,
            singular experiences tailored to your skill level.</p>

        <h2>Kayaking!</h2>
        <p>This trip is about wildlife viewing and relaxing. We view bald eagles, herons, and osprey on a daily basis and recommend bringing binoculars. Paddlers will see a mostly ponderosa pine environment in Lolo National Forest with potential to
            see moose, deer, river otters, ducks, and fish. Paddling new technology commercial grade inflatable kayaks is a great option for people wanting to be in charge of their own craft. Our guides provide the equipment, risk management and guidance
            to make it a wonderful river experience. We have both one and two person kayaks and can select from a variety of sections of river depending on flows. If you are a beginner, try something new and experience the sounds and smells of a river trip
            close up on a kayak. Kayaking is a unique and exciting way of traversing a river. There is no previous experience necessary and it makes an awesome family activity. Inflatable kayaking is a freeing experience, allowing you to not just go down the
            river but truly explore it. Safe, fun, and suitable for anyone!</p>
